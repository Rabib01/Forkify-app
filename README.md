🍽️ Forkify – Recipe Web App

Forkify is a fully functional recipe web app built with vanilla JavaScript. Users can search over a million recipes, adjust servings, bookmark favorites, and even upload their own recipes. The project follows an MVC architecture and uses modern ES6+ features, modules, and API integration.

Features
- Search from a large recipe database
- View detailed cooking instructions and ingredients
- Adjust servings (ingredients update automatically)
- Bookmark favorite recipes (saved in local storage)
- Upload your own custom recipes
- Fast, dynamic UI updates without page reloads

Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- MVC Architecture
- Parcel (Module Bundler)
- Forkify API for recipe data


Architecture

This project is structured using the Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern:

Model – Handles application data and API communication

View – Manages UI rendering and user interface updates

Controller – Connects the model and view, handling app logic

This structure keeps the code modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

API Used

This project uses the Forkify API to fetch recipe data and handle user-uploaded recipes.
